## Virtual Environment (Recommended)
It is recommended to create a virtual environment before installing dependencies:

Sample

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
## Installation
1. Open a terminal in this directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
